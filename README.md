📈 Displaying most recent audition entries to the top of the page 

📈 O-Auth/Passport functionality for the login page

📈 An analytics page that filters auditions by date, project, and casting director to show audition trends. 

📈 A Kanban like feature to track audition appointment progress. 


### Conclusion

This project encapsulates the extremely challenging yet rewarding accelerated learning experience I had during the past twelve weeks of this bootcamp. 
I was able to leverage my adaptability and creative thinking to be able to build something that addresses a niche problem space in the film and tv industry. 
The challenges I faced with creating this application was not being able implement key functionalities due to a tight deadline. This was especially problematic because I focused on features that I wanted to add that were a bit too ambitious when I needed to focus on a minimum viable product. I’m proud that I was able to establish a simple UI and set up storing my information in a proper database, bringing my idea to life. 

Over the past twelve weeks, I learned how to build software applications and also learned a lot about my areas of opportunities.
